#### Problem 0: You are playing a game at a carnival, the game involves rolling a 3 sided dice where: Rolling a
- 1 has probability of 0.2
- 2 has probability of 0.5
- 4 has probability of 0.3

#### If you land on the dice face 2, you get to flip a fair coin otherwise you will flip an unfair coin such that P(Tails)=.30 Let X be a random variable that represents the number of dots you see on a face of the dice, and Y be an indicator variable on whether the coin shows a head when flipped.
#### Find var(X+4Y)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(123)

n <- 10000000

dice_rolls <- sample(c(1, 2, 4), size = n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.3))

# Simulate coin flips based on dice rolls
coin_flips <- sapply(dice_rolls, function(x) {
  if (x == 2) {
    # Fair coin flip
    sample(c(0, 1), size = 1, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))
  } else {
    # Unfair coin flip
    sample(c(0, 1), size = 1, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7))
  }
})

# Calculate X + 4Y
X_plus_4Y <- dice_rolls + 4 * coin_flips

# Calculate the variance of X + 4Y
variance_X_plus_4Y <- var(X_plus_4Y)

# Print the result
cat("var[X+4Y] = ", variance_X_plus_4Y)
```

Problem 1: Consider the bus ridership example. Intuitively, $L_1$ and $L_2$ are not independet, show that $var(L_1-L_2)$ does not equal $var(L_1)+var(L_2)$. Determine the difference. (Find the 3 variances using simulation)
---

$L_i$ = # of passengers on the bus as it leaves stop i

$B_i$ = # of passengers boarding at stop i

P(leave) = 0.2 |
B(0) = 0.5 |
B(1) = 0.4 |
B(2) = 0.1

```{r, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(123)
nreps <- 10000000
nstops <- 2

# Simulate the number of riders at each stop
riders_at_stop <- matrix(0, nrow = nreps, ncol = nstops)

for (i in 1:nreps) {
  riders <- 0
  for (j in 1:nstops) {
    if (riders > 0) {
      for (k in 1:riders) {
        if (runif(1) < 0.2) {
          riders <- riders - 1
        }
      }
    }
    new_riders <- sample(0:2, 1, prob = c(0.5, 0.4, 0.1))
    riders <- riders + new_riders
    riders_at_stop[i, j] <- riders
  }
}

# Calculate the variances
var_L1 <- var(riders_at_stop[, 1])
var_L2 <- var(riders_at_stop[, 2])
var_L1_minus_L2 <- var(riders_at_stop[, 1] - riders_at_stop[, 2])
cov_L1_L2 <- cov(riders_at_stop[, 1], riders_at_stop[, 2])

# Print the results
cat("var(L1) = ", var_L1, "\n")
cat("var(L2) = ", var_L2, "\n")
cat("var(L1 - L2) = ", var_L1_minus_L2, "\n")
cat("var(L1) + var(L2) = ", var_L1 + var_L2, "\n")
cat("cov(L1, L2) = ", cov_L1_L2, "\n")
cat("Difference = ", var_L1_minus_L2 - (var_L1 + var_L2), "which is twice the negative of the covariance\n")

#### Problem 2 : The game is to toss a coin until we get r consecutive heads or reach a total of s tosses, whichever comes first.
#### Let X denote the number of tosses we make. We win $X. Find the minimum fee that should be charged for this game if r = 4 and s = 7. 

---

```{r, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(123)
r <- 4
s <- 7
nreps <- 10000000

simulate_game <- function() {
  consecutive_heads <- 0
  tosses <- 0
  
  while (consecutive_heads < r && tosses < s) {
    toss <- sample(c(0, 1), size = 1, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))
    tosses <- tosses + 1
    if (toss == 1) {
      consecutive_heads <- consecutive_heads + 1
    } else {
      consecutive_heads <- 0
    }
  }
  
  return(tosses)
}

results <- replicate(nreps, simulate_game())
expected_winnings <- mean(results)

cat("Minimum fee to be charged for the game: $", expected_winnings, "\n")
```

#### Problem 4: Let x be a random variable that denotes the sum of the values on a roll of 2 dice (8 sided dice with equal prob of getting any face (1-7)) 
1. What is the expected value of x?

```{r, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(123)

nreps <- 10000000

# Simulate rolling two 8-sided dice
dice_rolls <- replicate(nreps, sum(sample(1:8, size = 2, replace = TRUE)))

# Calculate the expected value of the sum of the dice rolls
expected_value <- mean(dice_rolls)

# Print the result
cat("Expected value of X (sum of two 8-sided dice) = ", expected_value, "\n")
```

```{r, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
r <- 2
s <- 5
p_heads <- 0.09
nreps <- 10000000

simulate_game <- function() {
  consecutive_heads <- 0
  tosses <- 0
  
  while (consecutive_heads < r && tosses < s) {
    toss <- sample(c(0, 1), size = 1, prob = c(1 - p_heads, p_heads))
    tosses <- tosses + 1
    if (toss == 1) {
      consecutive_heads <- consecutive_heads + 1
    } else {
      consecutive_heads <- 0
    }
  }
  
  return(tosses)
}

results <- replicate(nreps, simulate_game())
average_tosses <- mean(results)

cat("Average number of tosses until the game is stopped: ", average_tosses, "\n")
```
