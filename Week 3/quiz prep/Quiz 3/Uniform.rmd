#### Problem 4: The number of daily shoppers at target is uniformly distributed between 20 and 30+y.

#### How many shoppers should the target expect to see tomorrow?

In other words, what is the expected value of the number of shoppers at Target tomorrow?

```{r, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(123)
n_days <- 100000000

# Simulate the number of shoppers each day from a uniform distribution U(20, 42)
shoppers <- sample(20:42, n_days, replace = TRUE)

# Calculate the average (expected) number of shoppers based on the simulation
simulated_expected_shoppers <- mean(shoppers)
cat("Simulated Expected Number of Shoppers:", simulated_expected_shoppers, "\n")
```
