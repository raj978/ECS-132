This is the pdf for simulating question 5 from quiz 2.

# Analytical solution:
P(Z=3) = P(Tails) * P(Z=3 | Tails) + P(Heads) * P(Z=3 | Heads)

       = (1/2) * (1/6) + (1/2) * (1/4)

       = 1/12 + 1/8

       = 2/24 + 3/24

       = 5/24

       = 0.2083333

```{r}

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Set the parameters
n_simulations <- 1000000  # Number of simulations

# Function to simulate one game
simulate_game <- function() {
  coin_flip <- sample(c("Heads", "Tails"), 1)
  
  if (coin_flip == "Tails") {
    dice_roll <- sample(1:6, 1)
  } else {
    # Unfair die with 25% chance of rolling a 3
    unfair_probs <- c(0.15, 0.15, 0.25, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15)
    dice_roll <- sample(1:6, 1, prob = unfair_probs)
  }
  
  return(dice_roll == 3)
}

# Run simulations

# Calculate the probability
